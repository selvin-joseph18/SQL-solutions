1) Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel. (1 point possible)

 select hi.name,f.id1 from friend f join highschooler h 
 on f.id2 = h.id  join highschooler hi on
 hi.id  = f.id1 where h.name = 'Gabriel'

Andrew	1782
Jessica	1501


4) Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade.

select h.id,h.name , h.grade from highschooler h  left join likes l 

on l.id2 = h.id where l.id2 is null order by h.grade , h.name ;

1316	Austin	11
1911	Gabriel	11
1025	John	12
1661	Logan	12
 

5) For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades. 

select h.name,h.grade from highschooler h where h.id in(select  l2.id2   from likes l1  
right  join likes l2 
on l2.id2  = l1.id1   where l1.id1 is  null );

8) Find the difference between the number of students in the school and the number of different first names. 

select count-first_name as diff from

(select distinct count(id) as count from highschooler) R,

(select distinct count(name) as  first_name from highschooler) S;

9) Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student. (1 point possible)

select h.name, count(l2.id2)  as count  from likes l1   right  join likes l2
 
on l2.id2  = l1.id1 join highschooler h  
on h.id = l2.id2 group by l2.id2 having count>1  ;

                               (OR)

select h.name,h.grade from highschooler h where h.id in 
(select ID2 from likes where ID2=h.ID group by ID2 having count(ID2)>1);

12) What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)

select name,avg(total) as avg from (select h.name,count(id2) as total from highschooler h join friend f 

on h.id = f.id1 group by f.id1) r group by name;

Jordan	2.5000

14) Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends


select h.name,h.grade,count(id2) as count  from highschooler h join friend f 

on h.id = f.id1 and h.id =  f.id1 
group by h.name,h.grade having count>3 order by count desc ;
