2)Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

SELECT  DISTINCT m.year FROM rating r
INNER JOIN movie m 
ON r.mid = m.mid  
WHERE  r.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5  ORDER BY rating_date ASC;

1937

LEFT JOIN rating r
ON m.mid  = r.mid
WHERE r.stars IS NULL;

Star Wars null	
Titanic	  null

4)Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date

SELECT distinct re.name,r.rating_date FROM reviewer re
LEFT JOIN rating r 
ON r.rid =re.rid 
WHERE rating_date IS NULL ;

5)Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of 
stars.

select   re.name,m.title, r.stars ,r.rating_date 
FROM movie m  INNER JOIN  rating r 
ON  m.mid = r.mid INNER JOIN reviewer re
ON re.rid = r.rid ORDER BY re.name , m.title ,r.stars ASC;
